- [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io) - Manage your Cloud Services and copy files to other places. Free and open-source, better than AirExplorer.
- [AirExplorer](https://airexplorer.net) - Alternative to CyberDuck. Is proprietary and has a paid version which is good.

## **Useful Browser Extensions:**

These don't help much with online piracy, but will make your browsing much more private and safe.

- [Decentraleyes](https://git.synz.io/Synzvato/decentraleyes) - Free Content Delivery localization to protect privacy and browsing.
- [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) - Force HTTPS Connections on your Web Browser and be warned when a connection isn't secure.
- [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/) - Tracker Blocker for Chrome and FireFox (This is redundant and shouldn't be used with uBlock Origin, so get that instead).
- [Ublock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) - Wide-Scale Content blocker and AdBlocker
- [Universal Bypass](https://universal-bypass.org/) - Bypass stupid and annoying Link Shorteners like bit.ly 
- [LocalCDN](localcdn.org) - Alternative to Decentraleyes that is kept more up-to-date with extra features and CDNs added.

## **DNS:**

Using a privacy-focused DNS can speed up your browsing experience as well as make your network traffic more secure. They can also prevent you from your ISP snooping around on what sites you are going to and what you are doing on your web searches which is good for Piracy. (NOT a VPN substitute):

**Moderators' Choice: [Adguard DNS](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html)**

More trusted DNS providers can be found [here](https://www.privacytools.io/providers/dns/).

NOTE: DO NOT USE CLOUDFARE DNS OR YOUR ISP'S DNS AS IT IS NOT GOOD AND NOT WORTH USING AND THEY CAN SPY ON WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT

## **VPNs:**

- Recommending a VPN service is very difficult, so we'd like to point your VPN related questions towards [r/VPN](https://reddit.com/r/VPN).
- [Privacy Tools' VPN recommendations](https://www.privacytools.io/providers/vpn/)
- [VPN Comparison Chart](https://thatoneprivacysite.net/vpn-comparison-chart/)

**Tor is NOT a VPN, it will not protect you when torrenting!**
**Free VPNs aren't worth it and always find a way to make money off of you, whether its from logging, spyware, tracking, you name it! ProtonVPN and RiseUpVPN are fine, but you cannot torrent with them**

## **Unsafe software:**

- Utorrent - Same as Bittorrent, has ads, trackers, and is unsafe.
